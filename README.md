## Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Budget Tracker

### Description & User Story

This Progressive Web Application aims to give users a fast and easy way to track their money. This data is crucial to have at any moment in time. We also want the ability to have offline functionality to handle usersâ€™ financial information.

As an avid traveler, we want to be able to track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/ internet connection. This way we can ensure an accurate bank account balance. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
